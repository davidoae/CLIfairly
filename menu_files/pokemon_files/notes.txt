Specs:
1) Show a list of the pokemon in our inventory

0<(avatar) GIVEN_NAME L:$LEVEL
0  HP:#################------- $CURRENT_HP / $HP_MAX

-character_file that is a .tab listing all of the current pokemon in player's inventory? 
(by 'pokemon' we mean a ${pokemonUniqueID}.${pokemonID} file, the whereabouts of we don't know yet.)
-upon opening the 'pokemon' menu item we need to generate the pokemon menu as it appears to the player.

We need to be able to highlight two lines at a time.
2 options: 
1) We have a marked menu with 2 lines that have 'selected' and it's pretty much a literal version of the plan above^
2) We have a marked main menu with ONE line that has selected. Every time we redraw the map we redraw the secondary menu item (the one with current hp etc.) beneath the actually selected one.

Mertits of 1):
-better performance, maybe.
