V1) Map todo:
-draw maps (cool thing: we can draw maps that appear to be of irregular shape, by creatively using spaces!
-multiple entrances to a map:
hacky way: store an 'new entrance point' for each map
-places on the map having special properties not defined by what the character is:
1.separate file of functions for each map
-interaction with things on map eg. reading a sign
